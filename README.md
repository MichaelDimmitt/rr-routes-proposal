## react-routes proposal for react router
A command to list routes for an application that uses react router.

## Objectives:
1. List routes. (Currently this works via cypress + a react app running.) âœ…
2. Should allow static evaluation and not require the app to be running.  âœ…

## How it works
1. a top level typescript config enables interaction with jsx elements
2. the following command is used to run the implementations file with typescript `npx tsx src/implementations.ts`

## V1, react-routes worked but required both an app and cypress implementation to run.
## V2, react-routes is working and is a full cli solution with no server needing to run. ðŸŽ‰
It can be verified using the command: `npx tsx src/implementations.ts`

## Test data
</summary>

I need to find or create react-router implementations that:
1. show deeply nested route "object style" working.
2. show deeply nested route "component style" working.

Ideally these will be in the react-router examples codebase or be added when/if this change is pr'd. âœ…
This was achieved due to the update script in package.json that grabs the example folder from react-router.

Therefore, I am going to start using some of the react-router examples as my initial data-set.  
(list generated by looking at a few lines and then using count lines of code to find the largest examples.)
1. route-objects [examples/route-objects/src/App.tsx](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/main/examples/route-objects/src/App.tsx)
2. auth [examples/auth-router-provider/src/App.tsx](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/main/examples/auth-router-provider/src/App.tsx) 
3. transitions [examples/view-transitions/src/main.tsx](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/main/examples/view-transitions/src/main.tsx)

This project will have a test folder that uses cypress to assert the routes output match desired results. COMING SOON, currently exists in implementations file.
